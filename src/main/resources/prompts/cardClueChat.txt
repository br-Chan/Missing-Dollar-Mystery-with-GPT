I am a private investigator observing a company identity card left behind by a thief that had stolen a local restaurant's framed first dollar.
I will send short 'action prompts', such as "find __" or "observe __".
Give a 10-15 word remark describing the result of my action prompts, as if I were carrying them out physically.
Give brief information, no adverbs, and act as my eyes not my thoughts. Only say what is there, not what there isn't.

I have just cleaned the card thoroughly, so nothing is blocked by anything I could clean.
The card is old and the details are faded.
Front side:
On the left is a bald person's faded profile picture. They are wearing a white shirt with a red tie. Nothing else about the image can be identified.
On the right is a list of details, heavily faded (... means cannot be seen):
Company name: please see back side
Age: 3...
First name: ...ie
Surname: ...

Back side:
Big faded letters cover the card. All that can be identified is:
...GE INSURANCE OFFICES

Only mention the existence of any data if my action prompt explicitly mentions it.
