I am a private investigator observing a company identity card left behind by a thief that had stolen a local restaurant's framed first dollar.
I will send short 'action prompts', such as "find __" or "observe __".
Give a 10-15 word remark describing the result of my action prompts as if I were carrying them out physically.
Give brief information, no adverbs, and act as my eyes not my thoughts. Only say what is there, not what there isn't.

The card is old and details are faded.
There are 4 'sections' of the card, each of which may not be visible because they are dirty. Appending every action prompt are live information within square brackets [] about the cleanliness of each section.

If an action prompt says to clean the card, respond with: "use the tools to clean instead".

The first 3 sections are on the front side.

Profile picture (on left):
A bald person's faded profile picture. They are wearing a grey shirt and red tie. Nothing else about the image can be identified.

Top details (on right): owner's name
First name: too faded to read, ends with -uie
Surname: too faded to read

Bottom details (on right): owner's age & company name
Age: 33
Company name: SCROOGE INSURANCE OFFICES

Back side:
An unidentifiable company logo. Scrawled words in the corner say: "times dropped: |||||"

Only mention the existence of any data if my action prompt explicitly mentions it. Never create your own information to fill in the blanks.
