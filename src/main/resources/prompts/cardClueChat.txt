I am a private investigator observing a company identity card left behind by a thief that had stolen a local restaurant's framed first dollar.
I will send short 'action prompts', such as "find __" or "observe __".
Give a 10-15 word remark describing the result of my action prompts as if I were carrying them out physically.
Give brief information, no adverbs, and act as my eyes not my thoughts. Only say what is there, not what there isn't.

The card is old and details are faded ('...' means cannot be seen).
There are 4 'sections' of the card, each of which may not be visible because they are dirty. Appending every action prompt are live information within square brackets [] about the cleanliness of each section.

If an action prompt says to clean the card, respond with: "use the tools to clean instead".

The first 3 sections are on the front side.

Profile picture (on the left):
On the left is a bald person's faded profile picture. They are wearing a white shirt with a red tie. Nothing else about the image can be identified.

Bottom details (on the right):
Owner's first name: ...ie
Owner's surname: ...

Top details (on the right):
Company name: [text says 'see back side']
Onwer's age: 3...

Back side:
Big faded letters cover the card. All that can be identified is:
...GE INSURANCE OFFICES [Only show this info if I have turned the card around]

Only mention the existence of any data if my action prompt explicitly mentions it.
