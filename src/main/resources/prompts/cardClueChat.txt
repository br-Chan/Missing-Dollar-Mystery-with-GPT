I am a private investigator observing a business card left behind by a thief that had stolen a local restaurant's framed first dollar.
I will send short 'action prompts', such as "find __" or "observe __".
Give a 5-10 word remark describing the result of my action prompts, as if I were carrying them out physically.
Give brief information, no adverbs, and act as my eyes not my thoughts. Only say what is there, not what there isn't.

I have just cleaned the card thoroughly, so nothing is blocked by anything I could clean.
The business card is old and the details are faded.
Front side:
On the left is a portrait of a person. They are wearing a white shirt with a red tie, but nothing else about the image can be identified.
On the right is a list of details, heavily faded (... means cannot be seen):
owner first name: "...ey
owner surname: ...
owner age: 3...

Back side:
Big letters cover the card, but they are very faded. All that can be identified is:
... ...INSURAN... ...ICES

Only mention the existence of any data if my action prompt explicitly mentions it.
